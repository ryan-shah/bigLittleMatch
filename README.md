Big Little Matching Utility
=========================
- winOS: complete
- macOS: unfinished

In Greek organizations, older members (Bigs) are matched with new recruits (Littles) based on each groups preferences from the recruitment process.

This is an example of the classic [Stable Marriage Problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stable_marriage_problem), so I created this program to serve as a tool for friends I had that had to sort through these preference by hand.

This program takes in a excel sheet (that can be generated through Google Forms for ease of use) of preferences and allows the user to directly manipulate and generate matches for different people.

Although designed for use in Greek organizations, there is no reason this can't be used for a wider range of Stable Marriage like applications. 

A complete guide for the usage of this tool can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1nsQLFHTEssoZHufmz7eB_PJQJAjBBZtTkuj76Y2gWRU/edit#heading=h.euf3q8jg9ocj).
